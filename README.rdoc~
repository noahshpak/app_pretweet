== PreTweet

PReTweet is a web application that uses crowdsourcing to determine how audiences will respond to a potential tweet. 
This project was created by Noah Shpak at UPenn.

As of right now, the application utilizes Devise and twitter bootstrap for views.

I have added a sorting query to the indexing of Tweets to make it show by appropriateness score (to be implemented with Crowdflower)

== PreTweet

PReTweet is a web application that uses crowdsourcing to determine how audiences will respond to a potential tweet. 
This project was created by Noah Shpak at UPenn.

As of right now, the application utilizes Devise and twitter bootstrap for views.

There are now options for showing the first or last tweet submitted and the ability to view the table sorted by author name or appropriateness score.

I will be adding the functionality of Crowdflower (with their API) soon.  

This will involve creating a Job on Crowdflower with certain tweets specified by the user, starting the job, and displaying the results in a meaningful way when the Job has been completed.
